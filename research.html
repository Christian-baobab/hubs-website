      <h4>Refugee and Host Community-Led Research </h4>
      <p>
        <br> OSUN promotes research as critical to teaching and learning, supporting collaboration across borders, barriers and boundaries. The OSUN Hubs’ Refugee and Host Community-led Research Hub has two intersecting goals in supporting research initiatives: first, to support the Hubs’ wider advocacy efforts by raising awareness of the challenges refugees, IDPs, and host communities face; and second, to support the Hubs’ continuous reflection on camp- and urban-based needs, as well as program adaptation to serve those needs.</br>

        <br>
        <br> <b>Research Projects</b> </br>
        Research projects can take a number of forms, including  classroom action research, oral history, and ethnography, resulting in products ranging from standard research papers to sound projects, visual essays, documentary theatre,  or podcasts. Refugee- and host-community led research aims to inform OSUN blended learning classroom approaches and support OSUN Hub advocacy efforts on behalf of impacted populations. </br>  
        
        <br>
        <br> <b>Action Agenda</b> </br>
        The Research Hub engages in participatory action research projects in the camps to advance dialogues between local researchers and stakeholders and faculty from OSUN partner institutions. The aim is to support and embed locally-driven research agendas into wider OSUN consortia and programs. </br>

              <br>The RCoP is a value-driven project built around a community of practitioners and academics with a common interest in enhancing the capacity and voices of early career researchers in Somalia, Somaliland, South Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. We partner with RVI to expand the project and include refugees in Kakuma refugee camp.</br>

              Barriers to Refugee Integration in Kakuma and Kalobeyei, North–West Kenya
            </h4>
            <p>
              Why are the majority of refugees in Kakuma and Kalobeyei refugee camps in north–west Kenya resistant to the Kenyan government’s new official policy of integration with the local community? This paper explores this question through personal interviews and focus group discussions with a selection of refugees in the two settlement complexes and through a review of secondary literature. The paper argues that resistance among refugees to integration is not simply a reaction to external pressure but is deeply rooted in their lived experiences and fears of losing support from humanitarian agencies. It is also rooted in their concerns about the social and economic implications of assimilation into Kenyan society.

              From Uncertainity to Precarity: Moral Economy Practices among the Somali Community in Kakuma Refugee Camp
            </h4>
            <p>
              This paper explores how precarity shapes life for Somali refugees in Kakuma refugee camp, north–western Kenya. Contrasting contemporary precarity with the uncertainty that previously shaped livelihoods and social structures in Somali pastoralist communities back home, the study asks not only how things have changed but also how past experiences might be shaping novel challenges. Precarity in Kakuma refugee camp stems from multiple factors, including a lack of employment opportunities and a dependence on humanitarian aid. Nevertheless, despite this precarity, Somalis in Kakuma still demonstrate a kind of resilience through practices that elsewhere have been described as essential to pastoralists who are navigating uncertainty.

            <h4>Livelihoods and Prosperity: Exploring Self-relience Beyond Economics in Kakuma Refugee Camp</h4>
            <p>
              This paper explores how agency and livelihoods are articulated and shaped in the overall picture of refugee life as a whole, specifically in Kakuma refugee camp in north-western Kenya. It digs into the details of how refugees exercise self-reliance, resilience and identity, questioning conceptualizations of livelihoods framed purely in economic terms. It explores livelihoods as phenomena pursued by means of diverse economic, social and cultural activities, shaping identities and mindsets just as much as they shape financial success. The author draws on interviews and focus group discussions to examine the various factors influencing livelihood choices and goals.
