      <h4>The Hubs Capacity Building program focuses on building local capacity for program delivery and reiteration. </h4>
      <p>
        <br> The OSUN Hubs advocate on a global stage for those affected by displacement, by promoting the opening of higher education opportunities, supporting the lowering of barriers to access, and developing initiatives that chair the Working Group on Refugees, IDPs/DPs, and Host Communities, which meets monthly.</br>

        <br>The Working Group envisions a world in which higher education opportunities are accessible to all persons affected by crisis and/or displacement. By bringing together partners from across OSUN’s network, the Working Group seeks to provide educational opportunities to displaced populations, to create new knowledge in relation to refugees and displaced populations, to use that knowledge to advocate for educational access and the needed policy changes to ensure durable solutions, to cultivate strong connections between OSUN partners, and to foreground the university as an actor for social justice through education. To join the Working Group, please contact <b>hubs@opensocietyuniversitynetwork.org.</b> </br>  
        
        <br>The Hubs are firmly positioned OSUN as a global player in terms of education for displaced populations. Because of the work of the Hubs, OSUN has twice been elected as the co-chair of the Global Task Force on Education Pathways and continues to play an active role in setting direction of the 15x30 strategy by leading in the drafting of key multi-stakeholder documents and the implementation of programming in collaboration with global partners. </br> 
        
        <br>The Hubs have been asked to represent OSUN in the soon-to-launch UNHCR-founded Interagency “Global Leaders” Circle alongside the World Bank, USAID, Education Above All and Times Higher Education.</br>

              The Hubs are firmly positioned OSUN as a global player in terms of education for displaced populations. Because of the work of the Hubs, OSUN has twice been elected as the co-chair of <a href="https://edpathways.org/" target="_blank">the <b> Global Task Force on Third Country Education Pathways</b></a> and continues to play an active role in setting direction of the 15x30 strategy by leading in the drafting of key multi-stakeholder documents and the implementation of programming in collaboration with global partners. In 2022 alone, the Hubs led in the drafting of the Third Country Solutions for Refugees: Roadmap 2023; led the “Overseas & Program Infrastructure” drafting group for the US Pathways Initiative recommendation to the Bureau of Population, Refugees, Migration; collaborated with UNHCR on a panel for the UNESCO World Higher Education Conference related to the bridging programs and the Hubs key role in the space; acted as the only university network to be on a high profile panel at the Annual Tripartite conference on resettlement; and contributed significantly to drafting the UNHCR Tertiary Task Force Team’s Global Refugee Forum pledge. The Hubs have been asked to represent OSUN in the soon-to-launch UNHCR-founded Interagency “Global Leaders” Circle alongside the World Bank, USAID, Education Above All and Times Higher Education.

          <p>
            <br> With faculty, staff, and students from 16 OSUN institutions participating, the Summit focused on four key areas: building global student leadership in advocating for changes for those affected by displacement; launching OSUN student voices for refugees; academic panels; and launching a cultural heritage project in Kakuma/Dadaab.</br>

            <br>The Summit was part of OSUN's broader commitment to raising awareness and opening access to higher education and research opportunities for those affected by displacement, in the lead up to the second UNHCR's <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/events/global-refugee-forum-2023" target="_blank">Global Refugee Forum</a>  in December 2023 in Geneva. There, OSUN convened a key panel on the power of networks to achieve change in the refugee education landscape and served as the co-lead on the <a href="https://t.ly/zAUE3" target="_blank">15 by 2030 Multistakeholder Pledge</a> 15 by 2030 Multistakeholder Pledge, alongside UNHCR, the Government of Germany, and Times Higher Education. </br>

          <p>
            <br> The Bridge is a docudrama film that aims to raise awareness about humanitarian interpreters and to advocate for changes in their working conditions within humanitarian agencies.  The 30-minute film is based on a year-long collaborative research project with and about interpreters in Kakuma refugee camp.  It is written and produced by a group of Kakuma interpreters, who became OSUN Hubs research fellows. Following the production of The Bridge, several members of the research collective went on to establish their own Community-Based Organization (CBO) in Kakuma that aims to produce films to tell more Kakuma stories and advocate for changes <a href="https://photofilm4change.org">(https://photofilm4change.org).</a> The film was produced in collaboration with the Open Society University Network and the research and film supported in part by a grant from the Open Society Foundations, the National Endowment for Humanities, and the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research. The Bridge was filmed at InZone campus and other locations in Kakuma Refugee Camp.</br>
